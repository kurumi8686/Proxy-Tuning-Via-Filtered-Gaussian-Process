# Proxy-Tuning-Via-Filtered-Gaussian-Process

This repository corresponds to the paper *"Efficient Black-box Model Tuning via Gaussian Process Proxy Modeling."*

### Directory Overview
- **Experimental Data Screenshot**
  - Contains experiment reports for all datasets presented in the paper.
  - The *GP Filter* section includes the corresponding filter parameter configurations, allowing you to reproduce the GP filter method (all random seeds set to 42).

- **Code**
  - This directory contains the implementation for all datasets.
  - *Coming Soon...*
